**Patient Triage Gen AI** is an intelligent application designed to prioritize patients based on the severity of their medical conditions. It uses a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** architecture powered by **Groq** and **ChromaDB** to provide accurate and context-aware triage recommendations.  

---

## 🚀 **Key Features**
- **Patient Triage Levels**: Assigns one of 5 triage levels based on severity:
  - Level 1: Resuscitation (Immediate life-threatening condition)
  - Level 2: Emergency (Potentially life-threatening condition)
  - Level 3: Urgent (Serious but not life-threatening condition)
  - Level 4: Semi-Urgent (Less serious condition)
  - Level 5: Non-Urgent (Minor or stable condition)
- **Knowledge Base**: Uses a comprehensive database of medical guidelines and protocols for triage.
- **RAG Architecture**: Combines retrieval of relevant guidelines with generative AI for detailed explanations.
- **Console-Based Interface**: Provides a user-friendly console interface for input and output.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Generates triage reports in real-time using Groq's high-performance LLM.

---

## 🛠️ **Tech Stack**
- **Backend**: FastAPI
- **AI Model**: Groq (LLaMA 3.2-90B Vision Preview)
- **Vector Database**: ChromaDB
- **Embeddings**: Sentence Transformers (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`)
- **Console Interface**: Rich (for formatted output)
- **Environment Management**: Python Virtual Environment (`.venv`)

## 🚀 Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or higher
- Groq API Key (Get it from Groq Cloud)
- ChromaDB (for local vector storage)

## Installation
**Step 1: Clone the repository:**
```
git clone https://github.com/varshahindupur09/patient_triage_gen_ai.git
cd patient_triage_gen_ai
```

**Step 2: Set up a virtual environment and install dependencies:**

```
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Step 3: Set up environment variables:**
- Rename .env.example to .env.
- Add your Groq API key:
```
GROQ_API_KEY=enter_your_groq_api_key_here
```

- Initialize ChromaDB with medical guidelines
```
python app/chromadb_utils.py
```

- Run the FastAPI server:
```
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

- Use the console interface:
```
python console_interfaces.py
```

## 🖥️ Usage

### Console Interface:

- Run the console interface:
```
python console_interfaces.py
```
### Output:
```
Enter patient details:
Symptoms: Sudden severe headache, difficulty speaking, weakness on one side of the body.
History: None.
Preliminary Diagnosis: Suspected stroke.

View the triage report:
Triage Level: Level 1 (Resuscitation)
Explanation: Immediate life-threatening condition. The patient requires resuscitation and urgent medical attention.
```

### API Endpoints
```
GET /: Welcome message.
POST /assign-triage-level/: Assigns a triage level based on patient data.
```
```
